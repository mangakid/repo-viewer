## Getting Started

Please create a .env file with a [github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql) in the root directory like so:

NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_GQL_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>

This is needed to make authenticated graphql requests to the github gql api.

# To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
